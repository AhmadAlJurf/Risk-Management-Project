# Goal of this project
This project helped get a glimpse of what it is like being a Information Security Risk officer, therefore it was a great window into a certain career path that hopefully one day I get to take!
The first thing to add when looking at this project was to try to envision how to create a defensible
program, in this project I am aiming to draw out a mind map which would act as a representation of the
current and future state of any choosen company, I tired to understand all the different aspects and concepts related to
security in order to produce a high quality product that can help the choosen company in lowering damages and
losses. What is more, with this project I am also aiming to showcase the importance of the security field,
and how effective it is on our daily life. As our industry grows by the second I am hoping to showcase
with this project the bright future which we can uphold, this future will begin with us securing our assets
and network. Lastly I want to be able to express the creativity and passion that exists in the cybersecurity
field throughout this thesis.
