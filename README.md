The first thing to add when looking at this project was to try to envision how to create a defensible
program, in this project I am aiming to draw out a mind map which would act as a representation of the
current and future state of any choosen company, I tired to understand all the different aspects and concepts related to
security in order to produce a high quality product that can help the choosen company in lowering damages and
losses. What is more, with this project I am also aiming to showcase the importance of the security field,
